what i want is a way he can test this concept on some real data, i think historical data maybe? to understand how everything was like some time ago? and like use these data to see the charts change. can you conceptualise this approach? and add some changes to the interface too, use like fixed samples of thse data, yk , 4 samples let's say. cuz i saw this Docs/ Flat Files/ Quickstart Flat Files Quickstart Get started with Massive Flat Files via S3 A screenshot displaying CSV data and a graphical user interface powered by Flat Files, illustrating streamlined market data integration Massive's Flat Files provide extensive historical market data through convenient, compressed CSV files accessible via a S3-compatible endpoint. Instead of making potentially hundreds of thousands of individual REST API requests, Flat Files enables you to easily download large volumes of historical data with just a few clicks or commands, saving significant time and simplifying your workflow. If you're looking for smaller, on-demand queries, our REST API lets you request specific records like trades, quotes, or fundamentals. For real-time updates, our WebSocket API streams market data directly to your application as it happens. This guide walks you through how to manually download large historical datasets using popular S3 clients or our intuitive File Browser. While automated scripts or client libraries are common in production environments, manually downloading files is an easy way to explore data quickly or handle one-time data needs. Exploring and Downloading Data Flat Files are organized by asset class and data type. Available asset classes include Stocks, Options, Indices, Forex, and Crypto. Within each asset class, you'll find data types such as trades, quotes, minute aggregates, day aggregates, and more. To quickly explore and download historical data files, use the File Browser located in the left-hand navigation of this page. Simply select the asset class you're interested in and then drill down to access specific datasets available with your subscription. Alternatively, you can use an S3 client to automate and integrate Flat Files data into your workflow, as described in the following sections. Note: Data for each trading day is available by approximately 11:00 AM ET the following day.

This header exists across all files within a specific dataset, making it easy for you to interpret and integrate the data into your workflows. Setting Up S3 Access To download Flat Files using an S3 client, you'll first need to configure your environment with the appropriate access credentials provided by Massive: Ensure you have an active Massive subscription with Flat Files access. Obtain your unique S3 Access Key and Secret Key from your Dashboard. Use the following standard configuration details for all S3 clients: Endpoint: https://files.massive.com Bucket Name: flatfiles Massive officially supports several popular S3-compatible clients: AWS S3 CLI Rclone MinIO Python Boto3 SDK Below you'll find quick setup instructions for each client. AWS S3 CLI The AWS S3 CLI is an efficient command-line tool for managing S3-compatible data stores. Here's how to get started: Install the AWS S3 CLI from the official website. Run aws configure in your command line and enter your Access Key ID, and Secret Access Key. To interact with Massive's S3 files, use aws s3 commands: AWS S3 CLI # Configure your S3 Access and Secret keys aws configure set aws_access_key_id GLOBAL_TOKEN_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID aws configure set aws_secret_access_key GLOBAL_TOKEN_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY # List aws s3 ls s3://flatfiles/ --endpoint-url https://files.massive.com # Copy aws s3 cp s3://flatfiles/us_stocks_sip/trades_v1/2025/11/2025-11-05.csv.gz . --endpoint-url https://files.massive.com Rclone Rclone is versatile for syncing and managing S3-compatible storage directly from your command line. Here's how to get started: Download and install Rclone from here. Initiate a new remote storage configuration with rclone config. Here's an example configuration is provided below for reference: Rclone # Set up your rclone configuration rclone config create s3massive s3 env_auth=false access_key_id=GLOBAL_TOKEN_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID secret_access_key=GLOBAL_TOKEN_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY endpoint=https://files.massive.com # List rclone ls s3massive:flatfiles # Copy rclone copy s3massive:flatfiles/us_stocks_sip/trades_v1/2025/11/2025-11-05.csv.gz . MinIO MinIO client works seamlessly with any S3 compatible cloud storage. Here's how to get started: If you haven't already, download and set up MinIO from their documentation. Here's an example configuration is provided below for reference: MinIO # Enter S3 Access and Secret keys in config file ~/.mc/config.json mc alias set s3massive https://files.massive.com GLOBAL_TOKEN_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID GLOBAL_TOKEN_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY # List mc ls s3massive/flatfiles # View mc cat s3massive/flatfiles/us_stocks_sip/trades_v1/2025/11/2025-11-05.csv.gz | gzcat | head -4 # Copy mc cp s3massive/flatfiles/us_stocks_sip/trades_v1/2025/11/2025-11-05.csv.gz . Python Boto3 SDK Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python, which enables Python developers to write software that makes use of Amazon services like S3. Here's how to get started: Install Boto3 by running pip install boto3 if you haven't already. Utilize the following script to interact with Massive data: Python Boto3 SDK import boto3 from botocore.config import Config # Initialize a session using your credentials session = boto3.Session( aws_access_key_id='GLOBAL_TOKEN_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', aws_secret_access_key='GLOBAL_TOKEN_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', ) # Create a client with your session and specify the endpoint s3 = session.client( 's3', endpoint_url='https://files.massive.com', config=Config(signature_version='s3v4'), ) # List Example # Initialize a paginator for listing objects paginator = s3.get_paginator('list_objects_v2') # Choose the appropriate prefix depending on the data you need: # - 'global_crypto' for global cryptocurrency data # - 'global_forex' for global forex data # - 'us_indices' for US indices data # - 'us_options_opra' for US options (OPRA) data # - 'us_stocks_sip' for US stocks (SIP) data prefix = 'us_stocks_sip' # Example: Change this prefix to match your data need # List objects using the selected prefix for page in paginator.paginate(Bucket='flatfiles', Prefix=prefix): for obj in page['Contents']: print(obj['Key']) # Copy example # Specify the bucket name bucket_name = 'flatfiles' # Specify the S3 object key name object_key = 'us_stocks_sip/trades_v1/2025/11/2025-11-05.csv.gz' # Specify the local file name and path to save the downloaded file # This splits the object_key string by '/' and takes the last segment as the file name local_file_name = object_key.split('/')[-1] # This constructs the full local file path local_file_path = './' + local_file_name # Download the file s3.download_file(bucket_name, object_key, local_file_path) Next Steps Now that you've successfully accessed Flat Files with your S3 client, you can easily automate data retrieval and integrate historical market data into your workflows.
