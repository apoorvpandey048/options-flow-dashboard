Hi Nazir
I can setup and run ur bolt code in windsurf, debug, fix integration and run time issues, add /implement the extra features u need and test the flow. Can u tell about the frameworks , databases /APIs and target environment? U want to deploy on cloud or stage on a server ?

right now it's just a basic app , once it's hosted ,after testing and de bugging, i will have a better idea of what we need in the back end...i want to test the concept before getting too much into the back end..hope that makes sense

Apoorv Pandey
2:50 AM
Ok. So we have to run locally first. Alright. I can run on my system , see what the flow and issues. Basic stuff first. Then test app on railway/render, vercel etc. Can you share repo for this project? It will help understand more deeply

Apoorv Pandey

Totally fine ...I’m used to starting with rough ideas. You don’t need to have everything figured out upfront. I’m happy to start with the initial setup, run the app locally, surface the real issues, and get a simple live version up so you can test the concept properly. From there, we’ll have clarity instead of guesswork. If that approach works for you, I can take this forward as soon as you’re ready. You can also check out my GitHub profile too, I have done some projects tht required a lot of testing and reporting and workflow designing.

That said, let me know if I can help u

Hi, How much time would you need to help complete my app by integrating the existing Bolt-based code into Windsurf, thoroughly testing it, fixing bugs, and adding a few required features., so how many hrs approximately, thx

Apoorv Pandey
8:03 AM
I’d need around 1–1.5 hours to understand the existing code, set up the environment, and resolve any setup issues. Integrating it into Windsurf and making sure everything fits and runs correctly would likely take another 1–2 hours. Proper testing and debugging usually takes the most time, around 2–3 hours or more, since I’d want to thoroughly test flows and stabilize the app. So overall, I’d expect at least 5–7 hours for the current scope, with the final time depending on what additional features you’d like to add. If you can share those, I can give a more accurate estimate.

Thanks for sharing the Bolt link, Nazir.
I’ll go through the code, understand the flow and current setup, and then outline any integration or runtime issues I see when adapting this into Windsurf. Once I’ve reviewed it, I’ll let you know the exact next steps and confirm the timeline before starting work.

Apoorv Pandey
12:48 PM
I’ve gone through the Bolt version and also run it locally. Overall it’s a solid React + TypeScript app with auth, calculators, dashboard, journal, and charts already in place. The main blockers right now are missing Supabase env variables and a few sections still relying on mock data. Once we start, I’ll hook everything up to Supabase (CRUD), properly test and stabilize the flows, fix runtime issues, and put up a simple live deployment so you can test the concept. This still fits in the ~5–7 hour range. I’ll just need your Supabase URL/anon key and any priority features you want to focus on. I can give you Supabase-backed dashboard and journal (no mock data), fixed bugs and tested flows, and a live deployed version for concept testing.

Hi, I have a small project ( app) that I put together in Claude, it has a few bugs that i need you to look at, then add in API Key for real time stock market date, then put it on localhost or elsewhere ( free with login) and then I can test and see how it works before we add any more features...are you available, let me know and I can share the link with you

I can already see a few areas that are likely to cause issues (mainly around data handling and API integration), but to confirm and fix them properly I’ll need to run the app locally or review the actual project files. Claude previews don’t always surface runtime bugs.

Hi Nazir, I’ve cleaned up and stabilized the Claude prototype and put up a live demo so you can test it. I fixed the main frontend and backend issues, set up the GitHub repo, and deployed the app. I also reviewed a few live data providers and registered for the Schwab Trader API (Individual), but their access approval takes about 2–3 business days, so the app is running on simulated data for now to keep things moving. Switching to live data later will be straightforward. I’ve shared the live link, repo, and a short report summarizing what was done and the current status. Let me know if you run into any issues or have questions. I’m happy to help.

I did apply for the Schwab Trader API but the request was denied...so that path is closed for now. I also tried signing up for a few other broker/data options like Tradier, Polygon, etc., but truly real-time options flow is exchange-licensed and most providers gate it behind paid plans.

Apoorv Pandey
7:57 PM
If u already have or are open to opening something like Tradier, IBKR, or Schwab, we can plug into their API and use actual live options data for testing....or if u have other preferences then also, I will adapt to whatever works best for you.

NM
nazir m
11:44 PM
i have an account at Schwab, would that help? i found this on chatgpt...Finding truly free, real-time options data via API is challenging because exchange fees (like OPRA) are usually passed down to the user. However, there are a few reliable ways to get this data for free or at a very low cost depending on your technical level.1. Top API Providers with Free Options TiersThese providers offer official APIs with specific free tiers. Note that "free" usually comes with a limit on requests per day or a slight delay.ProviderAccess TypeLimitsKey FeaturesTradierREST / StreamingUnlimited for account holdersTruly Real-time. If you open a brokerage account (even with $0), you get access to their real-time options API for free.Alpha VantageREST25 requests / dayIncludes options chains and Greeks. Real-time is generally premium, but their free tier is great for testing.

try this not sure if it will work but it's from Massive api LpBKr1HoM_6Kau1JEhZvrMngPcKa4kb_

Apoorv Pandey
12:42 AM
If you have a Schwab account then you can try for the api access. Look for individual trader api . They rejected mine . That's worth a try I guess . And there's another thing

These data services use 2 modes , rest api and websockets

Rest api work like , we sending request to the server every 1-5 seconds regarding the updates going in the market , then server gives it back . This one will lag because of this reason .

But websockets work this way - server automatically pushes updates to us . Meaning it can maintain the live flow . And they cost , that's why most of those paid tiers use it and can give live data . The massive api key is of a free tier and they had i think 5 api calls per minute? So it'd be like we're updating the data every 20-21 second

If you're ok with little delay then we can use massive or other free services, because they are definitely using rest APIs.

If you're ok with little delay then we can use massive or other free services, because they are definitely using rest APIs.

Apoorv Pandey
1:00 AM
I was saying tradier because even there the websockets will have limits, but the rest api in it give 120 api calls /min. And I think if we are updating every 2-5 s then we can manage. I also have another strategy to utilise a bunch of these resources for our testing purpose. I will try your api key and other options too and update u with that .

Apoorv Pandey
1:11 AM
Due to some personal commitments I'll get back to your project by 28 dec . And will update the results from those APIs myself as soon as I can by 28 dec . We'll have this project move forward smoothly.

Hey, while I do seem to be making progress with your massive api, it still has some limitations, once wrapped up I will send an update. I’ll continue on this during the day.

Monday, Dec 29, 2025
Apoorv Pandey
12:49 AM
I tested your massive api thoroughly, even created my own free key and while we do get live-stock prices, the rate limit is very low and useless for our flow testing, true live options flow is much more restricted. On the free massive plan, we only get about 5 API calls per minute, and options data is mostly end-of-day only, no minutes data present which we need so real-time flow isn’t feasible without a paid plan.

To move forward productively, I was setting up a historical replay mode, where you can pick a past trading day and watch the options activity play out minute-by-minute using real historical data to let you clearly see how volume, flow, and signals evolve without worrying about api and stuff. The system is already structured so when you want to switch to live data later (Massive / Tradier / Schwab), it’s basically a plug-and-play change with no rewrite needed. I am currently looking where to get this historical data from. I think it will help you in testing the concept of your app with real data which I will try to be as recent as possible, like past few days.

Apoorv Pandey
1:13 AM
I had tried Massive key for historical data too, in our free plan we dont have access to S3 flat files. Like we do through rest api, REST endpoint technically exists but 5 calls / minute, each option contract = 1 call, SPY alone has thousands of contracts per day hence its impossible to reconstruct a single day for even this one, and we had more like QQQ, AAPL etc

hi

so just reading your summary, what do you think is the best way to handle the restrictions

Apoorv Pandey
2:28 AM
I think right now we should seperate live data, from concept validation, free APIs can’t support real-time or minute-level options flow. I thought it will be more practical to use it on past data

But I found even this data is restricted like our massive keys, the free one's didn't have any access to the s3 amazon buckets. But I am researching on ways to get us something that will give us "real" options flow data

I was also thinking of scraping from yahoo finance

but chat gpt said it will be unreliable, as we need options chain flow data, and they have like stock prices data

I don't know about trading, but tech yes.

NM
nazir m
2:34 AM
so ,let's look at it this way....If I personally want to see the option flow (real time) for the stocks listed on the app,( spy,qqq,tsla, aapl...etc) without any historical date but just as a proof of concept to test the validity for my personal use...so no back testing for now...whats the best way to do it

Apoorv Pandey
2:37 AM
The easiest way I could see is that you can try a tradier account. because they give claim to give these real time update support for free. and all the research i did from the very start, the best options for us was either use schwab or tradier api

did u apply for schwab's api ?

NM
nazir m
2:38 AM
not yet but will look at it on Monday

Apoorv Pandey
2:38 AM
Actually in my schwab account

now im not a trader

and when i applied

they took 2 days and rejected the request to api access

like not even documentations could be accessed

NM
nazir m
2:39 AM
k..i can try to apply on Monday...what about Tradier....will that data work?

Apoorv Pandey
2:40 AM
to understand how they fetch data, what are the limitations exactly. its only that they give access to those who fulfil their terms of service.

I highly think it should. Can u give me few minutes so I can read their docs again, I researched so many providers that info is quite jumbled in my head now. Just wait

NM
nazir m
2:42 AM
no worries..take u r time....

Apoorv Pandey
3:07 AM
yes tradier will give you 2 months free access

It should work for testing these concepts

NM
nazir m
3:15 AM
lets do that

Apoorv Pandey
3:16 AM
yeah, when you have setup, you share your api key with me, I will update the app and see what it will give us.

NM
nazir m
3:17 AM
so what do u need from need

Apoorv Pandey
3:17 AM
tradier api key

NM
nazir m
3:18 AM
k...give me about 30 mins..just on a call

Apoorv Pandey
3:21 AM
Tradier offers real-time stock and real-time options market data only if you are a Tradier Brokerage account holder — without that, you won’t get real-time options quotes. You just copy paste api key here on msg after setting up. I will continue then.

NM
nazir m
3:23 AM
k...might not work..but i will try to apply

i will try to do more research ..can we do this tommorrow

Apoorv Pandey
3:24 AM
Yea sure . I'll also look for more alternatives .

Do apply for the Schwab trader api. You have an account already, just sign to its developer portal using that.

1. Choose individual developer ( not company)
2.inside dashboard click " create app ", fill the name, description etc
3. Select market data/trading APIs
4. Submit nd wait
I will send some tips that increase our chances of getting selected. Signing off for now.

what about the option for $10 a month with schwab

would that give us athe data we want
